# stock prices prediction
This is a project analyzing and predicting stock prices of 14 different stocks listed on New York Stock Exchange. Through various different data manipulation techniques I was able to visualize key findings in the data by sorting and filtering the stocks into individual stocks. After that I was able to apply machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the prices of a few of the stocks.

Major thanks to my good friend Caleb Siow for giving solid pointers along the way.
